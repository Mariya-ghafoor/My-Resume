        <h2>PROJECTS</h2>
        
        <h3>BitsAuto    April 2012 - February 2013</h3>
        <h4>BitsWits</h4>									                                                                                                          
        The innovative platform seamlessly connected telecommunication vendors with clients by streamlining operations such as billing, call routing, data storage and managing users. It provided a comprehensive solution to VoIP service providers while reducing costs. The project leveraged a diverse technology stack, including Python, Django, Bootstrap, SQL, and Javascript, to deliver a highly performant, scalable, and secure solution.
        
        <h3>Android based Tracking System for a Moving Object 				                January 2011 - December 2011</h3>
        <h4>NED University of Engineering & Technology	</h4>				         
        The project involved programming an embedded system which utilised open WiFi networks to track a moving object in real-time thereby reducing dependence on satellites. This was successfully done by installing Android OS on a single-board computer (Devkit8000) which sent coordinates to a remote computer having a Java-based program which plotted object’s location on google maps. The system provided a cost-effective solution by leveraging open-source nature of the Android OS beyond mobile phones and tablet PCs. Nowadays Apple air-tags work on similar principles.
